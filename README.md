# Brain SM — Social Media Behavior Analysis Platform

## Overview
**Brain SM** is a prototype web application that analyzes **social media usage patterns** to provide insights into user behavior, engagement trends, and digital habits.  
The project explores how **AI, machine learning, and data analytics** can be used to generate meaningful behavioral summaries and visual reports from user activity data.

The system is designed as a **learning-focused and experimental platform**, emphasizing awareness, analysis, and responsible use of AI.

## Problem Statement
Social media has a significant influence on daily life, yet users often lack clarity on how their usage patterns affect focus, behavior, and mental well-being.

There is a need for a system that:
- Analyzes social media activity data
- Transforms raw activity into interpretable insights
- Presents reports in a clear, visual, and user-friendly manner
- Encourages mindful and informed digital engagement

---

## Solution
Brain SM provides a data-driven solution by:
- Analyzing daily social media activity signals
- Generating personalized activity reports and summaries
- Visualizing behavioral trends through dashboards
- Sending notifications and alerts to encourage healthy usage habits

The project also explores **advanced AI concepts** (at a prototype level) such as behavioral modeling and intelligent response systems for learning and experimentation.
